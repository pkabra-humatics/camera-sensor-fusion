# camera-sensor-fusion
The Camera Sensor Fusion 2021 intern project investigates the potential benefits of augmenting a Humatics Milo base station with an optional camera sensor.  Cameras excel at measuring angle-of-arrival of a transponder, while the Humatics Milo system excels at measuring the range to the transponder, so a camera is a natural secondary sensor.

The intern project has been performed by Pooja Kabra, with oversight and direction by @Chris Silvia
